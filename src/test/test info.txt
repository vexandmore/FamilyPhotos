A database must be created from photostest.sql called photostest, with the root password
specified in the source. The .sql file itself isn't actually used in the test.
Also note that TestConfig.json must exist and have the requisite configuration.
A sample file (TestConfigSample.json) exists, which is in the same directory 
where TestConfig.json must be.
